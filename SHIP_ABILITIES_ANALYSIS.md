## üéØ **DISTRIBUTION PATTERN**

### **How Abilities Are Assigned:**

```javascript
// ShipGenerator.js line 90
const abilityIndex = (index * 3) % abilities.length;
const ability = abilities[abilityIndex];
```

**Pattern:**
- Ship 3: Ability 9 (index 3 √ó 3 = 9)
- Ship 4: Ability 12
- Ship 5: Ability 15
- Ship 6: Ability 18
- ...
- Ship 31: Ability 8 (93 % 85 = 8) ‚Üê REPEATS!
- Ship 32: Ability 11 ‚Üê REPEATS!

**Cycle Length:** ~28 ships before pattern repeats

**Result:** Abilities distributed across ships, but with repetition

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **THE ISSUE**

### **Ships with Same Abilities:**

With 150 ships and 85 abilities:
- **85 ships** have unique abilities (one per ability)
- **65 ships** share abilities with other ships
- **Most common abilities** appear on 2-3 ships

### **Example:**
- Critical Strike: Might be on 2-3 ships
- Life Steal: Might be on 2 ships
- Chain Lightning: Might be on 2 ships

---

## üèÜ **COMPETITIVE CONTEXT**

### **vs. Competitors:**

**Galaxy Attack:** ~5 abilities total  
**Sky Force:** ~8 abilities total  
**HAWK:** ~10 abilities total  
**Phoenix II:** ~6 abilities total  

**Your Game:** **85 unique abilities** ‚úÖ

**Even with repetition, you have 8-17x more variety than competitors!**

## üìä **WHAT MAKES SHIPS UNIQUE**

Even with shared abilities, ships are still unique because:

3. ‚úÖ **Different Names** (150 unique names)
4. ‚úÖ **Different Costs** (varying unlock progression)
5. ‚úÖ **Different Visuals** (color-coded ship designs)
6. ‚úÖ **Same Ability, Different Stats** = Different playstyle

- Ship B: Critical Strike + Low Speed + High Health = Tank Sniper
- **Same ability, completely different feel!**
