# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files for the game:

## Required Sound Files:
- `shoot.wav` - Player shooting sound
- `explosion.wav` - Enemy explosion sound
- `powerup.wav` - Power-up collection sound
- `enemy_hit.wav` - Enemy hit sound
- `player_hit.wav` - Player hit sound
- `level_up.wav` - Level up sound
- `game_over.wav` - Game over sound
- `background_music.mp3` - Background music

## Free Sound Resources:
- **Freesound.org** - https://freesound.org/
- **OpenGameArt.org** - https://opengameart.org/
- **Zapsplat** - https://www.zapsplat.com/

## Note:
The AudioManager is designed to handle missing sound files gracefully. If sound files are not found, the game will continue to run without audio, and error messages will be logged to the console.

## Quick Setup:
1. Download free sound effects from the resources above
2. Rename them to match the required filenames
3. Place them in this directory
4. The game will automatically load them when it starts
