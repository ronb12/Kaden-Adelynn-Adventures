  └── ShipSelectionScreen.css ✅ (styles)
```

**Integration in Game.js:**
```javascript
Line 29: import ShipSelectionScreen ✅
Line 279: const [showShipSelection, setShowShipSelection] ✅

✅ Select button  
✅ Back button  

**Status:** ✅ **PERFECT - NO CHANGES NEEDED**

The Ship Selector **ALREADY HAS ITS OWN SEPARATE PAGE!**

It's in `src/components/Game/ShipSelectionScreen.js` and is:

**No changes needed!** Unless you meant something else?

---

## 💡 **IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE IT**

6. **Add Preview** (show ship in action)
7. **Add Sound Effects** (on select, hover)
