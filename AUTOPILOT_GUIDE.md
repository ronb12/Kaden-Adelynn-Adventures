---

## 🚀 Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Add AutoPilot to Game.js

At the top of your `Game.js`, add the import:

```javascript
import { autoPilotSystem } from './Systems/AutoPilotSystem.js';
```

### Step 2: Add to Game State

In your `gameRef.current` initialization:

```javascript
const gameRef = useRef({
  // ... existing state ...
  autoPilotSystem: autoPilotSystem,
  // ... rest of state
});
```

### Step 3: Add to Game Loop

In your game loop update function:

```javascript
// After all other updates
if (autoPilotSystem.enabled) {
  autoPilotSystem.update(deltaTime, game, game.keys);
}
```

### Step 4: Add to Render Function

```javascript
// After all other rendering
if (autoPilotSystem.enabled) {
  autoPilotSystem.render(ctx, canvas);
}
```

### Step 5: Add Event Tracking

In your collision/event handlers:

```javascript
// When enemy killed
autoPilotSystem.onEnemyKilled(enemy);
autoPilotSystem.onDamageDealt(damage);

// When player takes damage
autoPilotSystem.onDamageTaken(damage);

// When player dies
if (player.lives <= 0) {
  autoPilotSystem.onPlayerDeath();
}

// When boss defeated
autoPilotSystem.onBossDefeated(boss);

// When power-up collected
autoPilotSystem.onPowerUpCollected(powerUp.type);
```

### Step 6: Add Keyboard Control

```javascript
// In your keydown handler
if (event.code === 'KeyA') {
  autoPilotSystem.toggle(gameRef.current);
}
```

## 🧠 AI Behavior

### The AI Makes Smart Decisions:

**Offensive Mode** (Low threat):
- Pursues nearest enemy
- Aligns for accurate shots
- Maintains optimal distance
- Collects power-ups

**Evasive Mode** (High threat):
- Avoids enemies and bullets
- Moves to safe zones
- Still shoots when possible
- Prioritizes survival

**Target Selection**:
- Bosses get highest priority
- Kamikaze enemies next (dangerous!)
- Shooter enemies
- Damaged enemies (easy kills)
- Closest enemies

**Ultimate Usage**:
- Activates when threat level > 60%
- Saves for dangerous situations
- Uses strategically, not randomly

## 💡 Improvement Recommendations

The AI will automatically identify and suggest:

### Difficulty Issues:
- ❌ Game too hard → Reduce enemy spawn rate
- ❌ Game too easy → Add more variety
- ❌ Boss too difficult → Lower boss health
- ❌ High death rate → Add tutorial

### Pacing Issues:
- ⚠️ Waves too slow → Speed up progression
- ⚠️ Too many close calls → More health pickups
- ⚠️ Low survival time → Easier start

### Feature Usage:
- 💡 Ultimate never used → Make it more obvious
- 💡 No combos triggered → Better tutorial
- 💡 Low accuracy → Slower enemies
- 💡 No bosses defeated → Easier boss

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

### 1. Balance Testing
Run AutoPilot for 5-10 minutes to see if difficulty scales properly.

### 2. Feature Testing
Check if AI discovers and uses all features (ultimate, combos, etc.).

### 3. Bug Detection
AI will hit edge cases you might miss manually.

### 4. Difficulty Tuning
Get objective data on whether game is too hard/easy.

### 5. Performance Testing
See how game handles extended play sessions.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `AutoPilotSystem.js` to customize AI behavior:

```javascript
constructor() {
  this.difficulty = 'medium';  // easy, medium, hard
  this.playStyle = 'balanced'; // aggressive, defensive, balanced
  this.decisionInterval = 100; // Decision speed (ms)
}
```

**Aggressive AI**: Chases enemies actively, takes more risks
**Defensive AI**: Focuses on survival, avoids combat when possible
**Balanced AI**: Mix of both strategies

---

## 🔧 Advanced Features

### Custom Analytics:

Add your own tracking:

```javascript
// In AutoPilotSystem.js, add to analytics object:
this.analytics.customMetric = 0;

// Track it:
this.analytics.customMetric++;

// Include in report:
console.log(`Custom: ${this.analytics.customMetric}`);
```

### Custom Recommendations:

Add game-specific checks:

```javascript
// In generateRecommendations():
if (yourCondition) {
  this.recommendations.push({
    type: 'custom',
    priority: 'high',
    message: 'Your recommendation here'
  });
}
```
